This video introduces the Hazon framework series, which is designed to teach you how to build projects using large language models (LLMs). You'll learn about open-source and non-commercial LLM architectures, including RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and other important frameworks. The course will guide you through building question-answering systems step by step, with integration into Alpha, and will cover practical implementation using tools like Anki and the OpenAI API. The instructor plans to release videos weekly on weekends, with all code available on GitHub for hands-on practice. This series is part of a larger educational roadmap that will eventually include LangChain, RAG applications, and fine-tuning techniques, all building toward a comprehensive LLM diploma. The content is specifically aimed at contributing to Arabic tech education, providing you with the essential skills needed to develop real-world LLM applications from setup through advanced implementation.
